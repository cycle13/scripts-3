The purpose of this group is to prepare research quality oceanographic databases, as well as to compute objective analyses of, and diagnostic studies based on, these databases. Support is now from base funds and from the NOAA Climate Program Office.\n",
			" The data on which this atlas is based are in World Ocean Database 2009 and are distributed online and on DVD by NODC/WDC. Many data were acquired as a result of the IOC/IODE Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue (GODAR) project, and the IOC/IODE World Ocean Database project (WOD). At NODC/WDC, data archaeology and rescue projects were supported with funding from the NOAA Environmental Science Data and Information Management (ESDIM) Program and the NOAA Climate and Global Change Program which included support from NASA and DOE. Support for some of the regional IOC/GODAR meetings was provided by the Marine Science and Technology (MAST) program of the European Union. The European Community has also provided support for the Mediterranean Data Archeology and Rescue (MEDAR/MEDATLAS) project which has resulted in the inclusion of substantial amounts of ocean profile data from the Mediterranean Sea. Additional Black Sea data have been acquired as a result of a NATO sponsored project.\n",
